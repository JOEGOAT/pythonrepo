# Create three files - friends.py, nearby_friends.txt and people.txt
# we will be running friends.py throughout the project
# inside people.txt -> you can write alot of names -> Your classmates -> These are people that are near you
# inside friends.py -> We're going to write a short program that is going to :
# 1. Ask the user for a list of three friends
# 2. Then for each friend we are going to tell the user whether they are nearby (in the same city)
# 3. And finally, for each friend that is in the same city, we are going to save them to the nearby_friends.txt file 
# 3. -> For each nearby friend, we'll save there name to nearby_friends.txt

# |-> You can do this either by using the split() method of strings or you can ask the user fir three distinct friends -> Three inputs

# then you'll have to open the people.txt file and and read all of the lines
# hint: -> readlines() -> google about this function and see what you can find

# we will use it -> implement it in the project in a moment

# So you wanna read all the lines in people.txt, and thats going to give you a list of strings (a string per line) -> thats the friends or just people nearby
#  then we are going to compare the people in that file with the friends that the user entered, if the friend is in amongst thise people, we're gonna tell the user and also put them in nearby_friends.txt file
# So we are effectively copying the people file into the nearby_friends file selectively allowing the user to choose which friends they want to copy.

# So i would advice now,i know that this  a larger undertaking than we've done previously, and I dont necessarily expect you to be able to do it right off the bat, however, by building projects and struggling alittle bit, that is the best way to learn and to really get farmiliar with the research you have to do in order to become professional in programming.

# Give it a Go!!!! for like 15-20 minutes and the we can continue implementin this project together and i will explain all the choices that i am making in order to make it to work

# Lets go for it!!!
